How to install

am9511 is meant to be installed into an emulator.

We use zxcc here as an example:

https://www.seasip.info/Unix/Zxcc/

I use zxcc to cross compile HI-TECH C, and do "light testing".
zxcc will run mbasic

Ok

and I want to use MBASIC as a test harness. So, zxcc becomes the
first target. First, download and build zxcc, and make sure that
it works.

In directory zxcc-0.5.7/bin

Add files
    am9511.c
    am9511.h
    ansi.h
    floatcnv.c
    flaatcnv.h
    ova.c
    ova.h
    types.h

from the am9511 project.

Modify the Makefile:

- add "-lm" to LIBS
- add "am9511.$(OBJEXT) ova.$(OBJEXT) floatcnv.$(OBJEXT)" to
  am_zxcc_OBJECTS
- add -I. to CPPFLAGS (? may not be needed)

Edit zxcc.c

Replace:

unsigned int in() { return 0; }
unsigned int out() { return 0; }

with

/* support AM9511
 *
 * The interface is very simple -- if interrupts are not used.
 */


#define AM_STATUS 0x51
#define AM_DATA   0x50

unsigned int in(tstates,a,v) {
    unsigned int r = 0;
    if (v == AM_DATA)
        r = am_pop();
    else if (v == AM_STATUS)
        r = am_status();
    return r;
}

unsigned int out(tstates,a,v,a2) {
    if (v == AM_DATA)
        am_push(a);
    else if (v == AM_STATUS)
        am_command(a);
    return 0;
}


And, add

#include "am9511.h"

to the top of the file

"make" and "make install"

Now, zxcc should have the AM9511 emulator, as ports 80 and 81.

See AM9511.BAS for an MBASIC program that is the start of a test.

As am9511 matures, additional instructions on incorporating into
other emulators should be given. Not ready yet... so be careful.
